            <p class="text">
               The voice mail message could have come at a better time. He was not in an accepting
               mood.
            </p>
            <p class="text" id="paragraph">
               He squealed his car into the driveway, screeching to a stop just short of the garage door.
               He leapt out and slammed the door shut, hard enough that a car parked by the curb started to wail
               in automotive distress. He stormed up the steps to his house and kicked in the front door, taking
               care to unlock it and turn the handle first. It crashed back, its knob threatening to punch a hole in
               the wall except for the doorstop screwed to the baseboard.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He tore off his jacket, hurled it to the floor, bulled his way into the kitchen, and flung
               open the refrigerator door. It bounced off the wall and swung back. A shelf smashed into his arm,
               dislodging itself, spewing bottles of pickles, mustard, salad dressings, ketchup, and a jar of
               something he had bought a long time ago, and unless it was supposed to be covered with green
               fur, had gone to condiment hell. With a curse, he threw the door back again, then reached in and
               grabbed a can of beer.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               The fridge door pivoted back, banging into an assortment of bottles and jars littering the
               floor. He yanked on the pull tab of the can and downed half the beer while he clutched the
               counter, whether for support or just because it was there, he couldn’t have said.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               How dare she? How dare that . . . that . . . the epithet burbled in his mind like a gas
               bubble pushing through a sea of sludge, but he couldn’t, or wouldn’t—at least not yet—apply it
               to Julia. How could she have said such a thing? She knew how he felt. She sure as hell should
               have; they’d been going together for over a year. Well, screw it. If that was all the concern she
               had for his feelings, if that was all the respect she was willing to give him, better to find out now
               than when it was too late. Screw her.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He booted the bottles on the floor into the utility room, bouncing them off the dryer, then
               he slammed the fridge door shut. He heard something falling inside. To hell with it. He stormed
               into the living room with his half-empty can of beer, kicking his jacket against a wall as he
               passed it.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               The message light on his answering machine was blinking. Julia? Well, she’d damn well
               better be groveling before he’d even think of forgiving her. He stabbed the play button. Some
               androgynous voice droned that he had one message that had been delivered at 7:34. That was
               after he’d raged out of her apartment. This had better be good.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               The message played. At first, he wasn’t sure if the sounds issuing from the tinny speaker
               were a voice or just static. He cranked the volume to maximum and re-started the message.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               It was a voice. A woman’s. It reminded him of a weeping willow after a rainstorm. Of a
               radio tuned to a station almost too far. Of a eulogy. Of someone struggling to find the right
               words in an unfamiliar language.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               “I . . . I’m so sorry. Please. Please. I didn’t mean to hurt you. Please . . . for . . . forgive
               me. I love you so much. I couldn’t bear to go on . . . alone . . . without you. You are my life.
               Please. Don’t turn away. I need you. Please, Adam, call me. Any time. I’ll stay by this phone.
               Forever, if I have to. Please.”
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He stared at the machine as if it were an alien that had materialized in his living room,
               three thoughts tumbling in his mind: <em>that’s not Julia’s voice</em>; <em>that’s not
               Julia’s style</em>; <em>who the hell’s Adam?</em> Had some other woman hurled some
               insult at her man at the same time Julia had with him? Something destructive? Offensive? This
               couldn’t be a coincidence. Was Julia toying with him? Was this sarcasm? A sneering comment
               on his sensitivity? Would she revel in twisting the knife in his soul?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               Wait, there’s a way to find out. He remembered that you could get the number of the last
               person who called you. You just had to dial star something. What was it? Yes. Star sixty-nine.
               But what if someone else had called after she had? Then this wouldn’t work. He’d better do it
               before another call came it.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He pressed the keys. Star-six-nine. Another androgyne recited a number and offered to
               connect the call. He wrote it down and hung up. It wasn’t Julia’s. He didn’t recognize it but she
               could have used a friend’s phone. It’d be just like one of her stunts. He powered up his laptop
               and did a reverse lookup on the phone number. The address was on the other side of the city
               from Julia. She might have borrowed a friend’s phone, but she wouldn’t have bothered driving
               any distance to use it
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He replayed the message. No, that voice wasn’t Julia’s. Then whose? If it wasn’t her,
               then some other woman had insulted some other man: a guy named Adam, and then called a
               wrong number. But this woman wanted to make it up. She was more than apologetic, she was
               prostrating herself, pleading. She was servile.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He took a deep breath. Part of him was glad it wasn’t Julia. He’d never wanted any
               woman to fawn over him. Respect? Yes. Worship? Hell, no. Love? Why not. Idolization? Forget
               it. Besides, if this wasn’t Julia, it wasn’t his business. Delete the damn message and have another
               beer.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               But two people were about to be torn apart. By a misdialed number. He was done with
               Julia, but he had the power to reunite Adam and this mystery woman. What was the point in
               ruining two more lives?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He picked up the phone to call her. He’d explain about the wrong number, he’d wish her
               well, he’d hang up, and then he’d search through his contact list, mostly abandoned since he’d
               started seeing Julia. But the weekend was approaching and he needed a date. He dialed the
               woman’s number. The phone rang three times, then another vacant voice said, “We’re not home.
               Leave a message and we’ll call you back.” Whoever this woman was, she hadn’t bothered to
               record a greeting. Or maybe she hadn’t been able to. Maybe she needed Adam to do it for her.
               Maybe she was a helpless ditz.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               Oh, well, he’d tried. What the hell. He went out to the kitchen, reattached the shelf in the
               fridge, picked up the bottles from the utility room, and replaced them on the shelf. Then he
               grabbed another beer. And stopped. What had she said?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He went back out to the living room and replayed the message. “. . . I couldn’t bear to go
               on . . . alone . . . without you. You are my life.” He felt a spasm of alarm. Was this woman
               suicidal? Maybe he should call 9-1-1. And tell them what? That some wrong number sounded
               distressed? Dumb idea; even if they didn’t ignore him, he’d never find out what happened. But
               what if he didn’t call and tomorrow’s news reported a suicide at that address? He’d feel like a
               wretch.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               So what? This wasn’t his business. He stopped. What was he saying? So what? There
               could be a woman in crisis. He had the ability to intervene, perhaps even to save her life. And he
               realized that he cared about her. No, not about her; he didn’t know her. He cared that she would
               find the strength to carry on. Even without Adam. He knew that if he didn’t do something, sleep
               would evade him, the blackness of the night magnifying his fears of what she might do. There
               was only one way to handle this: he had to go there himself.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He grabbed his jacket from the floor, ran out of the house and into his car. He backed
               onto the road and accelerated down his street to a main highway. There, he pushed his car as fast
               as he dared. Her house was miles away, past industrial areas, strip malls, row upon row of traffic
               lights that turned red just as he approached them so some laggard could lumber into the lane in
               front of him. His phone rang. He ignored it. He couldn’t afford the time to pull over: to tell the
               caller he wasn’t interested in some Caribbean cruise. His imagination goaded him, flashing an
               internal video of him pulling up to her house, ambulances and police cars blocking the road,
               yellow tape blocking the sidewalk. But that was only if someone—Adam?—had found her. If not
               . . . . He stamped harder on the gas pedal. He had to get there in time.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He checked the street signs and pulled onto her street, lined with bungalows, templates of
               lawn and flower beds squatting in front, their house numbers hiding in the shadows of the
               streetlamps. A few visible numbers oriented him. Then he was there. This was the address. He
               checked the number on the door with the one he’d written down. By now, he knew it as well as
               he knew his age, but he needed to be sure.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               Lights glowed from behind drawn drapes, a black car parked on the street. The color of
               a hearse. He ran toward the front door, paused, and pushed the doorbell. If she didn’t answer . . .
               The door opened. A man about his age and build stood there, a woman about Julia’s age and
               build standing slightly behind. She was clinging to the man’s arm, gazing at him with an
               expression of . . . devotion?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He looked at the man and said, “Adam?”
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               The man nodded. “Yeah. Who are you?”
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He looked at the woman who was leaning on Adam as if they’d had reverse Siamese twin
               surgery, her arm locked through his in a grip he was sure even death would have trouble
               breaking. “Nobody.” He turned and walked back down the path to the street.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               “Wait. Who are you? What do you want?”
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               “Sorry, I have the wrong address.”
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He got into his car, drove around a corner, parked, and slumped back in his seat. Had the
               woman called Adam a second time? Had he called her? Whatever had happened, they were back
               together. She would never let him go. She would stick to him forever. They were one.
               <em>Poor bastard</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               His phone buzzed, alerting him to a message. It was from Julia. He played it.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               “Hey, bozo. Okay, maybe I went a bit too far earlier. My bad. But hey, if you’re gonna go
               all Incredible Hulk on me whenever I say something you don’t like, we’ve got a problem. I think
               we’ve got something good going and I sure don’t want to lose it, but I’m not going to turn into
               some compliant obedient little piece of fluff. If that’s what you want, buy a dog. If you want a
               real relationship, call me. I’ll be waiting. For a little while.”
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               Snickers turned into chuckles turned into roars of laughter, convulsing him, choking him,
               gasping for air. Now that was Julia.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               He took a deep breath, wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes, and checked his watch.
               10:45. She’d just be falling asleep; she went to bed early and she hated being called after ten.
               Great. He grinned, brought up her number on his phone, and pressed “Call.”

            <p class="text">
               In a way, this story is autobiographical. My wife, Sandra, isn't Julia, but they both
               share an attitude of independence. I'm working on a book about her journey through
               Parkinson's Disease (Sandra's, not Julia's). The following excerpt illustrates what I mean.

               The more I got to know Sandra, the more she fascinated me. She was
               different from other women I’d met because she didn’t know the rule or, more
               likely, belittled it. What rule?
            </p>
            <p class="episode">
               This was the mid-1960s, a time when women were still being denigrated.
               It was a time when it was unusual for a woman to drive a car; unthinkable for her
               to have a male passenger. It was a time when my boss could say to a roomful of
               employees that he’d never hire a woman as a computer programmer because
               women couldn’t think logically—and not get contradicted, hooted down, or
               reported to a human rights commission.
            </p>
            <p class="episode">
               And it was a time when women were taught the rule: never best a man—
               not in a game, never in a debate. Men, they were taught, wouldn’t have anything
               to do with women who were smarter than they were. So, my dear, if you don’t
               want to endure your dotage knitting booties for other people’s grandchildren,
               always let the fragile male ego win. (I’ve always felt this argument demeans men
               more than women. But then, I’m a man, cursed with a fragile male ego.)
            </p>
            <p class="episode">
               The rule was frustrating. Many times, I’d debate with a woman about
               some topic, usually one that she was more qualified than I was to discuss, and
               she’d have me, she’d made her point. All she had to do was jump up and down,
               hoot, and claim victory. But her eyes would glaze over, and the rule would rise in
               her head, and she’d mutter something like, “Well, maybe you’re right.” Was there
               a woman who would stand up for herself? Who would ignore the rule?
            </p>
            <p class="episode">
               I realized my search was over the first time I argued about something with
               Sandra. I think the debate had to do with health care, her specialty, and she’d
               won. Her logic and knowledge were superior to mine, and she knew how to
               express them in a way that left me no wriggle room. But just when I expected the rule to kick in, she pounced. Not only had she won, she made it clear she’d been dealing with someone who didn’t know what he was talking about. She triumphed, she was proud of it, and she celebrated her victory.
            </p>

               I was fascinated. Chagrined, but fascinated.
